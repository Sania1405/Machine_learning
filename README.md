##House Price Prediction - README.md
####Overview
This project builds a linear regression model to predict house prices. We use a dataset with various features of homes to train a model that can estimate the SalePrice of a house. The process involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.

####Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following dependencies. You can install them with pip install -r requirements.txt.

####Hardware: A machine with sufficient RAM and storage to process the datasets.

####Software:

Python 3.8 or higher

Jupyter Notebook or an IDE that supports .ipynb files.

Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt).

####Installation
Create and activate a virtual environment. A virtual environment is a good practice to keep your project's dependencies separate from other Python projects.

Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Linux/Mac:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages. After activating your virtual environment, run the following command to install all necessary libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt
####Usage
To run the project, open the House_price_prediction (17).ipynb notebook in your environment and execute the cells in order. The notebook will handle all steps from data loading to prediction.

Load the data: The notebook reads the train.csv and test.csv files. Make sure these files are in the same directory as your notebook.

Run all cells: Execute the cells sequentially to see the data processing, feature engineering, and model training in action.

####Output
The notebook's primary output is a prediction of house prices for the test dataset. A new CSV file named house_price_predictions_final.csv will be created in your output directory with the predicted SalePrice for each house.

An example of the output is shown below:

####Results Reproduction
To get the same results as shown in this project, simply follow the Installation and Usage steps above. The random_state=42 parameter used in the train-test split ensures that the data is split the same way every time, allowing for consistent results.

####Troubleshooting
Import Errors: If you see an ImportError, ensure you have activated your virtual environment and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies.

Missing Data Files: Make sure train.csv and test.csv are in the same directory as the notebook.

Memory Issues: If your machine runs out of memory, try reducing the size of the datasets or using a machine with more RAM.
