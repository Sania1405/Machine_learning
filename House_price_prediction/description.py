############ House Price Prediction Project####################
# This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices  using a comprehensive dataset of residential properties. The goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate regression model that can predict the final sale price of a house based on a variety of features, such as its size, quality, location, and other characteristics.

##########################Problem Statement###########################################
# The housing market is complex, with prices influenced by a large number of variables. The challenge is to use a rich dataset of historical home sales to train a model that can accurately predict a property's value. This model can be useful for real estate professionals, homebuyers, and financial institutions in assessing property value.

#######################Dataset###########################
# The dataset used is the well-known Ames Housing Dataset, which contains information on over 1,400 residential properties in Ames, Iowa, sold between 2006 and 2010. The dataset includes 80 features that describe various aspects of each house, including:

# Qualitative Features: Material and finish quality, condition, and style.

# Quantitative Features: Area, number of rooms, bathrooms, and garage size.

# Location and Date Features: Neighborhood and year of sale.

###########################################Methodology
# The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, including the following key steps:

# Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned to handle missing values. For categorical features, the mode was used for imputation. Numerical columns were checked for outliers, which were then handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure the model's robustness.

# Feature Engineering: New, meaningful features were created to help the model learn more effectively. This includes:

# TotalBath: A new feature combining the total number of full bathrooms, both in the basement (BsmtFullBath) and above ground (FullBath).

# Quality_and_Size: A new feature created by multiplying the OverallQual of the house by its LotArea to capture the combined impact of quality and size on price.

# Data Transformation: A ColumnTransformer from Scikit-learn was used to apply different preprocessing steps to different types of features:

# Categorical Features: OneHotEncoder was used for nominal features like Neighborhood, and OrdinalEncoder was used for ordered categorical features like ExterQual.

# Numerical Features: A StandardScaler was applied to numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is crucial for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

# Model Training: A Linear Regression model was trained on the preprocessed data. This model was chosen for its interpretability and strong performance on regression tasks.

# Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a held-out test set.

#->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Key Findings and Results->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# The model achieved a strong performance on unseen data, with a test R-squared score of 0.875. The R-squared score on the training data was 0.862, indicating that the model is well-balanced and does not suffer from underfitting or overfitting. The results demonstrate that the model can explain approximately 85% of the variance in house prices, providing a reliable prediction for new properties.
